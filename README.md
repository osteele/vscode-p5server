# p5-server

Launch a local developer server that knows about
[p5.js](https://p5js.org/libraries/) sketches.

An explorer view shows the sketches in the current workspace.

The status bar icons can be used to start and stop the server (‚úÆ5 Server), and
open the server root in the browser (üåêP5 Browser).

## Features

* **Live reload**. The browser reloads the page, when any file in its directory is
  modified.
* **JavaScript-only sketches**. Run a sketch that's just a JavaScript file (e.g.
  `sketch.js`). You don't need to create an HTML wrapper.
* **Automatic library includes**. If the server detects that a JavaScript-only
  sketch requires a [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/libraries/), it will
  automatically include it. (See
  [here](https://github.com/osteele/p5-server#automatic-library-inclusion) for
  how this works.)
* **In-Page syntax errors**. If a JavaScript file has a syntax error, it is
  displayed in the body of the page (you don't have to check the console).
* **P5-aware directory listings**. Viewing a directory in the browser lists the
  sketches, folders, other files in that directory.
* **Sketch scripts generation**. Create a JavaScript-only sketch that contains a
  minimal `setup()` and `draw()` function; or create a pair of `index.html` and
  `sketch.js`.
* **Sketch explorer**. A view of the sketches in the current workspace.

## Usage

It adds these commands to the command palette:

```text
'P5 Server: Start' // Start the P5 server
'P5 Server: Stop' // Stop the P5 server
'P5 Server: Open In Browser' // Open the p5 server URL in a browser
'Create p5.js Sketch File' // Create a new p5.js JavaScript sketch file
'Create p5.js Sketch Folder' // Create a new folder with a p5.js index.html and a sketch.js file
```

## Limitations

See the [p5-server
documentation](https://github.com/osteele/p5-server#limitations) for limitations
that also affect this extension.

In particular, this code has not been tested on Windows.

## Install

Follow the instructions in the
[Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=osteele.p5-server),
or run the following in the command palette:

```sh
ext install osteele.p5-server
```

## Configuration

The extension provides configuration settings to set the browser, and to hide
various user interface elements. Follow [these
instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) to modify
these settings.

## Technical Notes

The [p5-server](https://github.com/osteele/p5-server) companion project provides
the sketch analysis, library inference, and server features used by this
extension. See that package's [implementation
notes](https://github.com/osteele/p5-server#implementation-notes) for
documentation about how sketches are recognized and how library inference works.

## Acknowledgements

* The functionality and user interface of this extension were heavily inspired
  by Ritwick Dey's fantastic [Live Server
  extension](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/). This extension
  [does more](#features) for p5.js sketches, but it does not implement Live
  Server's [extensive list of features for general web
  development](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server#features).
* The extension uses the [open](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open#readme)
  package to open URL's in the browser.
* I learned a lot from reading the source code to the [vscode-project-manager
  extension](https://github.com/alefragnani/vscode-project-manager).
